To implement it for non-linear dynamic models (e.g. a car), analytic calculations for the matrices are necessary. In this talk, one can see, how the IPython Notebook and Sympy helps to develop an optimal filter to fuse sensor information from different sources (e.g. acceleration, speed and GPS position) to get an optimal estimate.\r\n\r\n## Topics\r\n\r\n### 1. Sensor Noise\r\n\r\nA very basic introduction to sensor noise and how to describe them statistically.\r\n\r\n![ax noise](ax_dist.png)\r\n\r\nYou need to download and run this [IPython Notebook]() locally, to see the interactive elements.\r\n\r\n### 2. Kalman Filter in 1D\r\n\r\nBasic introduction to the theory behind the filter algorithm in just one dimension.\r\n\r\n![Kalman 1D](Kalman-Filter-1D-Step.png)\r\n\r\nYou need to download and run this [IPython Notebook]() locally, to see the interactive elements.\r\n\r\n### 3. Multi-Dimensional Kalman Filter\r\n\r\nNow we are going multi-dimensional with matrices.\r\n\r\n![Kalman Filter](Kalman-Filter-Step.png)\r\n\r\n[IPython Notebook]()\r\n\r\n### 4. Extended Kalman Filter for nonlinear dynamics\r\n\r\nThis is actually a real life example, which fuses GPS measurements and IMU measurements of a real vehicle.\r\n\r\n![Extended Kalman Filter Step](Extended-Kalman-Filter-Step.png)\r\n\r\n[IPython Notebook]()\r\n\r\n## Video\r\n\r\n*coming soon...*\r\n\r\n## Presentation\r\n\r\n`Presentation.html` is made with [cleaver](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver): Simply `cleaver Presentation.md`\r\n","google":"UA-46744695-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
